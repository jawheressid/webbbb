# Installation guide for a fresh Windows setup
#
# 1. Install Python 3.11+ (64-bit) and ensure it is on PATH.
# 2. Open PowerShell in this project folder.
# 3. Create a virtual environment:
#      python -m venv .venv
# 4. Activate it:
#      .venv\Scripts\activate
# 5. Upgrade pip and wheel:
#      python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel
# 6. Install the project dependencies (run these commands in order to avoid resolver slowdowns):
#      pip install -r requirements-base.txt
#      pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
#      pip install -r requirements-langchain.txt   # installs langchainhub last
# 7. Optional sanity checks:
#      python test_imports.py
#      python test_env.py
#
# After these steps the environment mirrors the working setup on this machine.
